# reinforcement-learning-notes


These are my notes on reinforcement learning (and eventually, multi-objective and multi-agent reinforcement learning). 

Much of what you will see here is simply paraphrased (or lifted) from [Mutual Information's series on RL](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzvYlJMoZ02Dxtwe-MmH4nOB5jYlMGBjr) and Sutton and Barto's *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, 2nd edition*. I take no credit for their work!
